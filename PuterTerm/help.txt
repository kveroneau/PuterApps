Welcome to PuterTerm!

This is a very early version of this Terminal, and not really yet for public use,
but you may have found this by using my Puter Test App.

Here are the current commands implemented:

ls, pwd, cd, cat, clear, mkdir, mv, cp, vim, hacker

All the FS related commands listed work with the Puter File System.

The text editor does not yet support command-line arguments.

All FS commands are also limited to the App's AppDirectory.
