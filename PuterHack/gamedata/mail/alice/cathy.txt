Hi Cathy!

Thanks again so much for helping me get this job!  I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to be doing yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.  What's up with that
guy Brian?  He's really psycho about baseball.  Like it's the secret to the
universe.  He's a bit jumpy, too...  Anyway thanks again and I owe you a drink!

Alice
