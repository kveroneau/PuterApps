****** SPOILER ALERT! *******
This file contains all the answers for those having trouble!
I've been noticing that not many hackers made it very far
in the game at all, so I thought I'd include this here
solution file for those struggling.

Your first step, if you haven't done so yet, is to read the
the "readme" file on this host.  This will unlock a new
command, the "run" command.

You will need to use the "run" command to connect to the
gateway server in order to gain access to the corporate
network which is behind a firewall.

I highly recommend typing "help" at every new segment, as
it reveals all the available commands to you.

From the "hack>" prompt, use the "gate" command, and the
username is "alice", her password is "password".

This will connect you into the corporate gateway, from
here you need to "jump" to her workstation, to do that,
use the "jump" command like this "jump alice".  You will
then be prompted for Alice's password again, which is
"password".  The only thing you can do on her workstation
is read her mail.  From reading her mail, you should
determine that user "brian" has the password of "baseball".

To connect to Brian's workstation, first exit Alice's using
the "exit" command.  This will bring you back to the gateway
server.  From here type in "jump brian", and enter in his
password, "baseball".  On his computer, after reading his
mail, you will determine that "Cathy" likes this band
called "OverniteDynamite", and visiting their website by
typing in "web overnitedynamite.com", you should determine
that Cathy's password is "love".

Disconnect from Brian's workstation, and "jump cathy", and
read her personal mail.  You notice that user "David" is
very similar to user "brian", so David's password is also
"baseball".  Disconnect from Cathy, and "jump david".

You will notice a new website, "ReUsingNature.com", visit
it by "web reusingnature.com", and you should then
determine that the user "elise" has the password "hireme",
and she's an HR manager.

Disconnect from David's workstation, and "jump elise", and
read her personal mail.  You will notice that she basically
gives away the password for user "frank", but you will first
need access to his HR files to determine his birthday.

At this point in the game, you will receive a new mail from
your employer.  Exit all the machines and go back to your
localhost, and use the "mail" command there to "show hr" mail
message.  Your employer installed a new program, "hr".

Use the "run" command again, then from "hack>" type in "hr".

Here you need to log in as user "elise" with password "hireme",
and you will have access to the HR Database.  Your target
is user "frank", but you can also look up other users you
have seen so far to learn more about then.  To perform
a search, first use the "search" command, then type in
"frank".  This will show that his password is "11111971".

Disconnect from the HR database and from "hack>" use the
"gate" command again and log in as user "frank" with the
password "11111971".  Then use "jump frank" and type in
the same password a second time.  Open his "mail" and read
this messages.  You will now determine the username format
and the obvious password for all sales reps in the Reps
system.

At this point, you will receive a new mail from your employer.
Go back to your localhost and read it.  It will unlock the
"reps" command in "hack>", which will give you entry into
the Reps system.  The username is "gford", and the password
is "may".

This is where the single player game comes to an end currently.
