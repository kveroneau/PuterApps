# A port of the famous HackRUN engine to ObjectPascal!

This is a port of the game engine, and the demo of the popular Android hacking simulation game *HackRUN*!

They once had a demo of the game which you could download, but I cannot find that demo anymore.  This game is based on the demo of HackRUN, it does not contain any content past the original demo.

**DISCLAIMER:**  I do not take any credit for the storyline or scenario, and in the future, the HackRUN demo scenario may be replaced with a scenario of my own creation.  With that said...

## How to create your own scenario!

Easy!  Take a look inside the `gamedata` directory and modify the scenario files to your hearts content!  You may also need to adjust the in-game triggers from the ObjectPascal source code, I will make an update to allow creating triggers without modifying the engine itself.

Once you make your changes, fire up your ObjectPascal compiler, and compile away!
